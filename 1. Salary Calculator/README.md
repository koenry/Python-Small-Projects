## LT and EN language

The calculator comes with English and Lithuanian languages.


## Quick notes

Tax exempt changes every 6months to a year I will try to update the code everytime it changes.
There are a lot of online calculators now but back when I thought about making a simple open-source-code calculator there were only a few online calculators but riddled with ad's.
Just to make some QoL changes for people in need of a salary calculator.
